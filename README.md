# AutoTile

A simple system to automatically connect similar tiles, to look like Terraria or Minicraft. (Known as Auto-Tiling).
Useful for tile-based games such as sandbox, platformers, etc.
Requires 3.25 tiles worth of art for each tile type, while other methods could require 15+, even for a worse effect.
